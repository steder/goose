* TODO Typos should probably be errors
** TODO Don't implicitly create database 
   Misspelling a database name shouldn't create a new db
** TODO Don't implicitly insert migration_info
   Running migration on an existing db that doesn't have migration_info
   maybe should not create a migration_info table so you're not accidentally
   inserting migration info all over.
* TODO Database Backup Option
* TODO Re-order/Re-run database migrations
* TODO Smarter Algorithm to determine which migrations have been applied
  Currently we're just doing comparison of migration version vs max
  database migration version.  I'm thinking a set based algorithm
  which takes into account both the version and migration name might
  do a better job of handling changes.
* TODO Migration_info table should contain a migrationDate 
  It could be useful to know when a migration was run and if it was 
  in the order you expect.
